# Automated Risk Register Orchestration Engine (ARROE)

An enterprise-grade GRC Risk Register automation project built on ServiceNow.  
The system ingests risk data from an ISO 27001-aligned ISMS risk register (CSV import), automatically calculates Inherent Risk Scores, enforces predefined risk rating thresholds, and assigns globally unique risk IDs for audit traceability.
